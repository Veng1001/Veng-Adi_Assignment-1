Hey Andrew and Danielle,

As the repository is made after the presentation.
The following drive links are proof that we didn't tamper with any files,
i.e. you can see last edited dated is around the time of canvas submission.

Furthermore, For convienience we tried to add all the files to this new repository for you to have access all files, 
but failed miserably, as The gitHub does not allow us to add files more than 100mb to the repository. Hence the drive links.

Apologies for inconvenience.

Thanks
Veng & Adi
